This project is aimed at developing a complete online ordering system for use in the food service industry which will allow the "Admin" to quickly and easily manage online restaurants and their menus, which customer can browse and use to place orders with just a few clicks. The idea with this project is, to help the customers around the city to easily enter our web app, create an account and choose from which fast food shop, restaurant or any kind of food service around the city (which would want to be shown on our food delivery service) they want to eat.

- This project is a Capstone for college purposes.
